# Swarm Learning for Heart Disease Detection

This project is focused on using swarm learning and big data to build a model that can detect heart disease. The dataset used in this project is collected from Kaggle and is available at the following links:

Swarm learning is a novel approach to machine learning that utilizes decentralized computing to enable data sharing and collaborative learning while maintaining privacy and data security. This approach is particularly well-suited for large-scale datasets where traditional machine learning methods may not be feasible.

The project's tech stack includes:

- Model ANN (Python)
- Backend: Golang
- Frontend: VueJS
- Cloud service: GCP (or AWS)

By leveraging the power of swarm learning and big data, we aim to create a model that can accurately detect heart disease and improve patient outcomes.
